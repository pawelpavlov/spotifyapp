This is Tinder for music - the user likes or dislikes the track that is shown.

To run the project just hit f5 in VS

Currently implemented:
- Cards displaying tracks
- New track is displayed after like/dislike
- POST is being set on like/dislike

TODO:
- Logic for recomending music, storage of past choices
- Some statistics displayed below the cards
